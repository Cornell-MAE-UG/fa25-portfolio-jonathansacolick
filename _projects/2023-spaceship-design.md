We were asked for class to design a system that maximizes lifting capabilities. This is what I came up with. The photo to the right shows the derevation and design for the solution. 

The max mass this design can lift is 25kg 
The max height this design can lift to is 50.64mm


Ways I could improve: 
    In order to imrpove, I could have optimized the distances better to maximise both lifting height and mass as a function of extention. This however is above my capabilities at this point in time, as when trying I was not able to model this design succesfully.
